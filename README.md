# SMGrNN

This repository primarily utilizes Hebbian learning to achieve unsupervised continual learning for agents.

## Introduction

SMGrNN is a neural network model based on Hebbian learning rules, aimed at achieving unsupervised continual learning for agents. Hebbian learning is a learning mechanism based on synaptic plasticity between neurons, which adjusts the weights of neuron connections to achieve learning and memory.

## Features

- Unsupervised Learning: No labeled data required, the agent can learn autonomously.
- Continual Learning: The agent can continuously learn and adapt in a constantly changing environment.
- Based on Hebbian Learning: Utilizes biologically inspired learning rules to improve learning efficiency and stability.

## Installation

Please follow the steps below to install and configure the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SMGrNN.git
cd SMGrNN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
